Coordinate-Ascent
=================
Implementation of a basic Coordinate Ascent (same thing as Coordinate Descent, just 'reversed'), as well as the Lasso implementation.

## Modules
This repository has basically 4 modules:

* Class to synthesize some data (with noise)
* Coordinate Ascent
* Coordinate Ascent for Lasso
* File to test everything

## Requirements

* Python 3.3 (but might also work with Python >= 2.6)
* Numpy >= 1.7
* Matplotlib >= 1.3.0
* For comparison with Lars: scikit-learn >= 0.14
