Coordinate-Ascent
=================
Implementation of a basic Coordinate Ascent (same thing as Coordinate Descent, just 'reversed'), as well as the Lasso implementation.

## Usage
Run this app via `python3 gradient_descent.py stochastic linear` or in multiple ways at once via 
`python3 gradient_descent.py stochastic linear batch linear stochastic logistic batch logistic `

## Modules
This repository has basically 3 modules:

* Standardize which standardises a matrix
* Gradient Descent which has separate functions for stochastic and batch method using linear and logistic regression
* File to test everything

## Requirements

* Python 3.4
* Numpy >= 1.9
* Matplotlib >= 1.4.0
